                    I came to know about Programming Hero from my uncle. He inspired me to enroll in their Web Development course. I joined the course in December 2023. Initially, everything was going well, but towards the end of the course, I faced some technical device issues and couldn’t keep up with the course flow. Later, I joined a reset batch, and during that time, Batch 11 opened for enrollment in December 2024.

                    At that point, I set a goal for myself—to achieve something meaningful. The Programming Hero team supported me a lot in that journey. In the end, I gave my best and successfully transformed myself into a junior web developer.

                    I am generally considered a frontend developer, as I don’t have advanced skills in backend development. I enjoy working in the frontend, especially creating responsive UI/UX designs. I am also skilled at adding unique and user-friendly features to websites.

                    Besides programming, my hobbies include playing video games, sports like cricket, football, and more. I also have a strong interest in ethical hacking. In my free time, I love listening to music.
